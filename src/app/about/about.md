This exhibition is about Strøksnes, a small village in northern Norway where Ørjan grew up and the place where Fran feels very much at home.

It is a place of long cold winters with beautiful dark blue skies, long hot summer days and midnight sun, a place surrounded by wildlife and spectacular scenery, of sea and mountains, and a place full of friends and family and community and history. 

This exhibition tries to capture something of Strøksnes through the eyes of two different photographers with two different relationships to the place, two different styles of photography and two different printing styles.

Fran Watson has been experimenting with photography for about three years now and started working in the darkroom in 2023.

Ørjan Laxaa has been photographing since taking a course in high school, many, many years ago.
